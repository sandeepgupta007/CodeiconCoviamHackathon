Interview Scheduling:

Using automatic scheduling so as to minimize the manual work for scheduling of interviews

This repository uses Genetic Algorithm that evolves and generates a most optimal solution for this problem.

though I have tried my best to write the code which is self explanatory but if still there are some portion of code which is tough to do please comment them down and I'll change that too.

A lot can be imporved on this algorithm, I need suggestion about improving fitness function.

Q. How input file works for now ?

Time is mapped to code

9-10 is 1

10-11 is 2
...

..

similalry upto 21 is 12

INPUT Format:

firstline of input is number of candidates = N

subsequent N lines contain 4 letters each representing the timeSlot candidate is available in a priority

Next line Contani Number of interviewers (HR)

subsequent N line contain ( first number is the total number of slots ) next pairwise values represent the day and the time slot on that day.

Last line contain the numberOfDays interview is supposed to continue


CAUTION: There are no checks/error handling in this code. So if you find any error comment it or make this visualing appealing.
